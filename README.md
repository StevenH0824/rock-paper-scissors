Creating this simple game using JavaScript. From what I read this is just going to be the logic of the game where I will come back later to add the GUI aspect of the game.

Made the changes to the interface and created buttons that the user can use to make a selection. I styled the page up a bit too look more presentable using flexbox which gave me some challenges. Using flexbox while generating elements through JavaScript seem a bit complicated in terms of styling the page when new elements are created in DOM.
I enjoyed making this webpage but I also hated how long it took. The algorithm can be more efficient but I'd say most of my time was spent reading the material from the odin project. What I feel took the most time for me from this project was my way of handling the exceptions and to automatically terminate the program and using regular expressions if the user entered a wrong key. This was sadly something that I ultimately had to take out of the project towards the end since the keyboard inputs changed to buttons. 
I need a bit more pratice with using JavaScript to create elements. I have a understanding of what the DOM is but I just need more practice with creating/styling elements in JavaScript. In my opinion I feel that it is better to just use JS to create elements rather than do any styling. I do however see the application of using JS to style something quickly during a click. With animations that could be something that would look more visually appealing to the user.
 I read 2 chapters of eloquent JS which I feel is a good resource. My only problem with that book is that it seems to be linear as they build upon previous examples from chapters I haven't read. It's also pretty lengthly so I have to allocate some of my time to reading that. I'm probably going take around a 5 day break after finishing Foundations to read a couple of chapters from this book and other resources as well.
